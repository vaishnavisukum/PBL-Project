Jewelry Store Website Development Roadmap
Project Overview

A modern, responsive jewelry store web application where users can browse products, search/filter, add to cart, and place orders. Admin can manage products, view orders, and track inventory.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, CSS/SCSS, React Router, possibly Redux or Context API

Backend / Authentication / Hosting: Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Functions)

Database: Firebase Firestore (or Realtime Database)

Hosting: Firebase Hosting

Team Roles & Responsibilities
1) Frontend Developer (React.js)

Goal: Build the user interface and client-side interactions.

Tasks:

Set up React project (create-react-app or Vite)

Implement responsive design (mobile-first)

Create pages/components:

Home page (featured products, banners)

Product listing page (grid view, filters, search)

Product details page

Cart & Checkout pages

User authentication pages (login, signup, profile)

Integrate with Firebase for user authentication and data fetching

Handle routing with React Router

Connect frontend to backend API or Firebase functions

Ensure smooth UI/UX (loading states, form validation)

Milestones:

Basic project setup + routing

Home & product listing pages

Product details + cart functionality

Checkout & payment integration

Authentication & user profile

2) Backend Developer (Firebase + Cloud Functions)

Goal: Implement business logic and server-side operations.

Tasks:

Set up Firebase project & enable services:

Authentication (email/password, Google login)

Firestore database / Realtime Database

Cloud Functions for server-side logic

Hosting

Implement APIs (if needed):

Fetch products

Create/update orders

Admin product management

Handle security rules for Firestore

Implement backend logic for:

Adding/removing products from cart

Checkout & order placement

Inventory updates

Admin dashboard functions

Milestones:

Firebase project setup + basic auth

Cloud functions for products & orders

Secure database rules

Integration with frontend

3) Database Manager (Firebase Firestore)

Goal: Design, maintain, and optimize database structure.

Orders Collection: userID, productIDs, quantities, total price, status

Manage indexes for fast queries (filtering & search)

Ensure data consistency & integrity

Set up security rules & permissions

Optimize queries for performance

Optional: analytics for product views, purchases, etc.

Milestones:

Finalize database schema

Implement security rules

Connect database to backend functions

Test queries & real-time updates

Workflow & Collaboration

Version Control: Git + GitHub (branches for frontend, backend, database work)

Communication: Slack / Discord / Trello / Jira for task tracking

Integration Steps:

Database manager finalizes schema → Backend dev sets up API functions → Frontend dev fetches data & implements UI

Continuous testing with dummy data

Deploy incrementally on Firebase Hosting
